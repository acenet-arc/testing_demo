# Testing demo

This is intended as a seed-repository for a workshop on how 
to use Git-Collaboration sites like GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket.

It is used in several episodes of the lesson that is available at:
https://acenet-arc.github.io/git-collaboration

See [Workflow.md](Workflow.md) for the steps how this repository
is intended to be used.

The files used are based on Katy Huff's SWC lesson on testing.
