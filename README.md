# Testing demo

This is intended as a seed-repository for a workshop on how 
to use Git-Collaboration sites like GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket.

It is used in several episodes of the lesson that is available at:
https://acenet-arc.github.io/git-collaboration

See [Workflow.md](Workflow.md) for the steps how this repository
is intended to be used.

The files used are based on Katy Huff's SWC lesson on testing:

* Lesson: https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-testing/
* Lesson repo: https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/python-testing/

This repo has example pipeline definitions for:
* GitHub actions (`./more_files/github_actions.yml`)
* GitLab CI (`./more_files/gitlab-ci.yml`)
* Travis CI (`./more_files/travis.yml`)
